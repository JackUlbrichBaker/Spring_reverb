Hello! This is a "simple" spring reverb using a high current op amp to drive a ~600ohm impedance spring reverb with ~4.5mA of current.  The signal path is entirely analog and uses jfets to emulate that smooth TUUUUUUbe sound for guitar purists.
Almost entirely so I have cheap reverb on my amp and so I can show off I know how to design analog circuits when I apply for jobs.
